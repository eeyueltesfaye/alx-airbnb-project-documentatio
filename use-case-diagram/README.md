# Airbnb Clone â€“ Use Case Diagram

This repository contains a detailed **Use Case Diagram** that visualizes the core features and user interactions for the **Airbnb Clone Backend System**. The diagram helps stakeholders, developers, and designers understand how users (guests, hosts, and admins) interact with the system and how various backend functionalities are organized.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Description

The diagram illustrates major backend modules such as:

- **User Management** (Registration, Login, Profile)
- **Property Listings**
- **Search & Filtering**
- **Booking System**
- **Payment Integration**
- **Reviews and Ratings**
- **Notification System**
- **Admin Dashboard**

The diagram uses:
- ðŸ§­ `<<include>>` relationships for mandatory use cases
- ðŸ”€ `<<extend>>` for optional behaviors
- ðŸ‘¥ Generalization for actor inheritance (e.g., Guest and Host inherit from User)
- ðŸ–¼ A **clear system boundary** to frame all backend functionalities
